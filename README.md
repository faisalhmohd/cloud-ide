# Personal Cloud IDE

This repo hosts code to prepare my cloud IDE. It currently uses Theia IDE, mimics majority of VS Code features and exposes it under port `3033`.

For more [information](https://www.theia-ide.org/)

## Setup Instructions

```
# Prequisites - Install Docker, Docker Compose

$ docker-compose -f <path to docker-compose.yml> up 

```

It is recommended to add an alias of the above command either on `.bashrc` or your favourite shell (`config.fish` for example).
